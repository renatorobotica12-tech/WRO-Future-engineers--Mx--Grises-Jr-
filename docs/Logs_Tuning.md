## 📊 Iterative PID Controller Tuning Log

The closed-loop controller was tuned iteratively on the official track using a systematic trial-and-error approach. The objective was to achieve an optimal balance between damping on the straight sections and steering responsiveness in the corners.

| **Iteration** | **$K_p$** | **$K_i$** | **$K_d$** |   **Speed**   | **Observed Behavior / Trajectory Analysis**                                                                                                                                                                           |         **Result**         |
| :-----------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------: |
|   **Test 1**  |    1.80   |    0.00   |    0.00   |   Low (30%)   | **Critical oscillation.** The robot enters a severe overcorrection loop on the straight section, resulting in continuous zigzagging until it collides with the wall.                                                  |         ❌ Rejected         |
|   **Test 2**  |    1.00   |    0.00   |    0.00   |   Low (30%)   | Oscillation is reduced on the straight section; however, the Ackermann steering response is too slow when entering tight corners, causing the robot to deviate from the intended trajectory.                          |         ❌ Unstable         |
|   **Test 3**  |    0.70   |    0.00   |    0.00   |  Medium (35%) | Acceptable centering on the straight sections at low speed. However, as chassis inertia increases, the robot exhibits understeer, resulting in insufficient steering response in the corners.                         |  ❌ Further Tuning Required |
|   **Test 4**  |    0.70   |    0.00   |    0.20   |  Medium (35%) | A predictive braking effect becomes noticeable. The robot rapidly reduces lateral oscillations after exiting a corner.                                                                                                |        ⚠️ Promising        |
|   **Test 5**  |    0.90   |    0.00   |    0.40   |  Medium (35%) | Excellent response. The 45° sensor fusion anticipates the upcoming curve effectively, allowing the robot to remain near the center of the track with minimal oscillation.                                             |          ⚠️ Stable         |
|   **Test 6**  |    0.90   |  0.00001  |    0.20   |  Medium (30%) | The accumulated error rapidly saturates the steering actuator due to track imperfections. As a result, the robot deviates uncontrollably from the intended trajectory.                                                |        ❌ Saturation        |
|   **Test 7**  |    0.95   |  0.00001  |    0.35   |   High (45%)  | After regulating $K_i$, increasing the base speed introduces a slight correction delay during the straight-to-corner transition due to increased inertia. A stronger derivative action is therefore required.         | ⚠️ Further Tuning Required |
|   **Test 8**  |    1.10   |  0.00001  |    0.30   |   High (45%)  | Increasing $K_p$ provides the steering aggressiveness required to enter tight corners at high speed, while the derivative term effectively compensates for the resulting kinematic effects.                           |         ✅ Accepted         |
|   **Test 9**  |    0.80   |  0.00001  |    0.25   | Maximum (60%) | When operating near the physical limits of the motors, the chassis begins to drift due to rear-tire slip. Consequently, the ideal kinematic model becomes less accurate because of tire friction and dynamic effects. |      ❌ Physical Limit      |
|  **Test 10**  |    0.80   |  0.00001  |    0.20   | Maximum (60%) | The robot consistently completes all three laps while maintaining relatively clean trajectories and stable lap times.                                                                                                 |  ✅ **Semi-Ideal Baseline** |

### 💡 Analysis of the Integral Term ($K_i$)

Starting with **Test 6**, it was determined that the integral gain ($K_i$) should be maintained at **0.00001**. This decision was primarily driven by the occurrence of **integral windup**. Because the corners generate a sustained tracking error for short periods of time, the integral term accumulates error and produces unnecessary additional steering torque. This causes the Ackermann steering mechanism to deviate from its intended geometric response, ultimately compromising the overall stability of the prototype.

Therefore, a low but non-zero integral gain of **$K_i = 0.00001$** was selected as the final value, providing limited compensation for accumulated tracking error while minimizing the risk of excessive integral accumulation and actuator saturation.


## 📑 Notes
However, the tuning process did not end with these ten iterations. We continued applying the same systematic methodology, performing additional tuning rounds to further refine the controller's performance. The ten tests presented above represent only a representative portion of the tuning process; in total, we conducted approximately **40–50 additional iterations**, continuously adjusting the PID gains and evaluating the robot's trajectory, stability, and performance at different speeds.

This extended iterative process allowed us to progressively identify the limitations of the controller and converge toward a more reliable set of parameters for the final implementation.
